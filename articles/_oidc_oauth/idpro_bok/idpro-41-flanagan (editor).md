_**Editor’s Note:** This is a consolidated list of the terminology highlighted in each of the articles published in the Body of Knowledge (BoK). It is not, by any means, a definitive or even broadly supported set of definitions; the context an individual reader brings to the table will influence how accurate the terminology for their use case. We offer the consolidated list here as a touchpoint for discussion. Article authors are encouraged to review and use existing definitions before offering new ones for terms already described in the BoK._

_You are encouraged to also read the article, “_ [Words of Identity](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/86/) _” by Espen Bago, for a cautious view of how, despite efforts like this Terminology document, words in the IAM space are often ambiguous._

_Please consider offering feedback to the articles that use these terms via the IDPro GitHub repository: [https://github.com/IDPros/bok](https://github.com/IDPros/bok) ._

| Term | Definition | Source |

| Access Control Lists | Access Control Lists are definitions around who or what are allowed or denied access to a resource. For example, a file share may have an Access Control List that allows Marketing Department users to read and write, IT Department users to read-only, and denies all other users’ access. | [Authentication and Authorization](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/78/) |
| Access Control System | a structure that manages and helps enforce decisions about access within an organization. | [Introduction to Policy-Based Access Controls (v2)](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/61/) |

| Access Governance | Access Governance provides oversight and control over access rights implemented in multiple local or shared authorization systems. These rights may be controlled in a variety of ways, starting with the existence and validity of the digital identity. Other controls include various mechanisms such as policies, the mapping of roles, permissions, and identities. The abbreviation used is for Identity Governance and Administration and is commonly used in the commercial sector. This roughly corresponds to the Access Certification section of the first-class component Governance Systems in the FICAM model. IGA is not specifically addressed in the ISO/IEC model. | [IAM Reference Architecture](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/76/) | 
| Access Management | Use of identity information to provide access control to protected resources such as computer systems, databases, or physical spaces. | [Introduction to IAM Architecture](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/38/) | 
| Access Management | The process and techniques used to control access to resources. This capability works together with identity management and the Relying Party to achieve this goal. The model shows access management as a conceptual grouping consisting of the Access Governance function and the shared authorization component. However, access management impacts local authorization as well (through the governance function). | [IAM Reference Architecture](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/76/) |

| Adaptive Authentication | Adaptive authentication aims to determine and enforce the authentication level required at any time during a user session - when the session is commenced, during the session when access requirements force a re-evaluation, or when the session token expires. The factors to be used in achieving that authentication level are determined dynamically based on the access control policy governing the resources being accessed, and a variety of environmental conditions and risk factors in effect at that time for that user. | [Designing MFA for Humans](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/) | 
| Agent (also “Customer Service Agent”) | The person responsible for communicating with and solving problems on behalf of customers or end-users. | [Account Recovery (v2)](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/) , [Managing Identity in Customer Service Operations](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/65/) |

| Certificate Policy (CP) | A document that defines the high-level policy requirement for a PKI. RFC 3647 identifies a PKI's policy framework and describes a CP's contents and outline. An enterprise operating a CA will often publish its certificate policy to external parties so they can determine whether to trust certificates issued by the CA. | [Practical Implications of Public Key Infrastructure for Identity Professionals](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/80/) | 
| Certificate Practices Statement (CPS) | A CP identifies the requirements for managing a CA and issuing PKI certificates. A CPS describes how a CA implements those requirements. The CPS uses the same outline as the CP, defined in RFC 3647. Unlike the CP, enterprises rarely publish their CPS in unredacted form. | Practical Implications of Public Key Infrastructure for Identity Professionals |

The digital wallet contains digital cards. | [A Peek into the Future of Decentralized Identity](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/51/) |
| Directory | A directory is a central repository for user identities and the attributes that make up those identities. A user identity might be John Smith with firstName attribute as John, lastName attribute as Smith, title attribute as Director, and Department attribute as Marketing. The attributes in the directory can be used to make authorization decisions about what this user should have access to in applications. | [Authentication and Authorization](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/78/) |
| Discretionary Access Control | a pattern of access control system involving static, manual definitions of permissions assigned directly to users. | [Introduction to Policy-Based Access Controls (v2)](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/61/) |
| dPKI | A decentralized public key infrastructure and is usually implemented via an immutable blockchain or ledger – a place where DIDs can be registered and looked up alongside the associated public keys of the DID and its metadata. dPKI can be described more generally as the _verifiable data registry_ , as the dPKI is just one of many possible implementations for a verifiable data registry. While this paper refers to dPKI, the reader should be aware that a verifiable data registry need not necessarily be “decentralized”. | [A Peek into the Future of Decentralized Identity](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/51/) |

| Identity Federation | An identity federation is a group of computing or network providers that agree to operate using standard protocols and trust agreements. In a Single Sign-On (SSO) scenario, identity federation occurs when an Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP) agree to communicate via a specific, standard protocol. The enterprise user will log into the application using their credentials from the enterprise rather than creating new, specific credentials within the application. By using one set of credentials, users need to manage only one credential, credential issues (such as password resets) can be managed in one location, and applications can rely on the appropriate enterprise systems (such as the HR system) to be the source of truth for a user’s status and affiliation. | Identity federations can take several forms. In academia, multilateral federations, where a trusted third party manages the metadata of multiple IdPs and SPs, are fairly common. [1](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/62/#fn1) This article focuses, however, on the enterprise use case where **bilateral federation** arrangements, where the agreements are one-to-one between an IdP and an SP, are the most common form of identity federation in use today. | [Federation Simplified (v2)](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/62/) |

An identity hub can be anywhere – on the edge, on the cloud, or on your own server. Its purpose is to store personal data. Some implementations may allow other entities to access the identity hub of the user if the user specifically grants such access. You can think of an identity hub as the individual’s personal data store. | [A Peek into the Future of Decentralized Identity](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/51/) |
| Identity Information Authority (IIA) | This represents one or more data sources used by the IDM as the basis for the master set of principal/subject identity records. Each IIA may supply a subset of records and a subset of attributes. Sometimes the IIA is distinguished from the Identity Information Provider or IIP. We use IIA to include the service that actually provides the information as well as the root authority.
